            <h3>What is PianoDB?</h3>
            <p>
              PianoDB Voicings is a comprehensive database of piano chord voicings derived from real musical performances. 
              Our system analyzes over one million musical pieces to identify the most commonly used chord voicings and their 
              relative frequencies in actual musical contexts.

          <div className="about-section">
            <h3>How it Works</h3>
            <p>
              The database categorizes chord voicings by their pitch class sets and provides detailed analytics including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> How often each voicing appears in the analyzed corpus</li>
              <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Total time each voicing is sustained across all performances</li>
              <li><strong>Digest:</strong> A unique identifier representing the specific pitches in the voicing</li>
              <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Percentage breakdowns of usage patterns</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h3>Data Sources</h3>
            <p>
              Our analysis is based on multiple datasets of piano performances, including classical, jazz, and contemporary 
              music. We use the Aria-MIDI dataset (2025) by Bradshaw et al. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Just like the original Aria-MIDI dataset, our data is released under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0
            </p>
            <p>
              We are committed to transparency and open science, and all datasets on <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/conjuncts/voicings">huggingface</a> are available for research and exploration.
