            <h3>What is PianoDB?</h3>
            <p>
              PianoDB Voicings is a database of over <b>14.7 million</b> piano chord voicings, derived from real musical performances. 
              We analyzed over one million musical pieces to identify the most commonly used chord voicings and their 
              relative frequencies in actual musical contexts.

            <h3>Data Sources</h3>
            <p>
              Our analysis is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15071">Aria-MIDI (2025)</a>, a corpus of over one million MIDI files covering genres from classical, jazz, to contemporary music. However, there is a focus on classical piano. Rare chords (those found less than 10 times) are excluded.
